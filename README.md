# Project-Euler
A collection of my solutions to Project Euler problems. Problems 1-20, 24, 67 are written in Java, the rest are Python. I'm just using this to learn/practice so don't expect much.

The goal isn't to make the best algorithm, just to make a relatively quick one and to get some practice.

##### Note on primes
Some of my early solutions have prime generating functions that are quite inefficient. In problems 10, 27 (among others) a more efficient algorithm is used, but I won't be replacing the algorithms in the early problems as they generate so few primes the efficiency loss is negligible.
