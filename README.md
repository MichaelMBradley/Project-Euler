# Project-Euler
A collection of my solutions to Project Euler problems. Problems 1-20, 67 are written in Java, others are written in Python. I'm just using this to learn/practice so don't expect much.

Some of my methods are good, some are **terrible**, but most are *okay* and they all eventually lead to the right answer.

##### Note
Use problem 10 if you want a not as bad way of computing prime numbers. Other problems have a method that compute the first n primes, but they're pretty slow.
